# Tridle

We are planning to make an idle with which you can chop trees and buy upgrades.

## Features

- [Interfaces](https://github.com/ColinvD/Tridle/tree/Develop/Tridle/Assets/Scripts/Interfaces)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/ColinvD/Tridle/blob/Develop/Tridle/Assets/Scripts/Resources/ResoucreHandler.cs)
- [A*](https://github.com/ColinvD/Tridle/tree/Develop/Tridle/Assets/Scripts/PathFinding)

## Software Analysis
Javascript has a wide area that it allows to do so you can do things that normal game engines wouldn't allow. You can use javascript to make / test something online so you don't need to compile every thing before you can test it. MonoGame is really good for 2d games because it is direct with doing things so you don't need to have a canvas to draw something. We chose Unity because it is easier to put a playable demo online and it's direct with errors and gives a good explanation about the error.

## Learning Goals
What do we want to reach with this project:
- Make a good / decent Class Diagram
- Good documentation
